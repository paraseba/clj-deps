clj-deps
========

`clj-deps` assists you in understanding the structure and dependencies of
clojure code. It can generate a dependency graph of clojure namespaces and,
optionally, write it to a file in `.dot` format. Then, using
[Graphviz tools](http://www.graphviz.org/) you can turn that file into a
(sometimes) nice image of your dependency graph.

You can filter parts of the graph if you are interested only in
some namespaces of your system or its dependencies.

Usage
=====

* Install `clj-deps`, it depends on `clojure` and `clojure-contrib`.
* In the `bin` directory you will find an executable you can use to set the
  `CLASSPATH`
* Launch the REPL and call the functions you need.

Example
========

This call

     (write-dependency-graph "clj-deps/src" "clj-deps.dot")

will generate a file named `clj-deps.dot` with `clj-deps` dependency graph.
If then you do:

     dot -Tpng clj-deps.dot -o clj-deps.png

you turn that `.dot` file into this image

![clj-deps dependency graph](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/paraseba/clj-deps/clj-deps.png "clj-deps dependency graph (without tests)")

You can see other examples in [the wiki](http://wiki.github.com/paraseba/clj-deps).

ToDo
====

* Use Maven
* Namespace translation
* Custom node attributes
* Command line interface
* Automatic image generation

Since we have a graph, we can do pretty interesting stuff like:

* Cycle detection
* Topological order
* What not.
